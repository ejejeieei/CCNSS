    "## Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini project we will implement a recently developed planning method called monte carlo tree search. This algorithm combines the strengths of a structured tree search with the exploratory behavior of random \"rollouts\" to focus on promising parts of the state space, and has been particularly successful with perfect information games using a large state space (such as go). Similarly to RL, planning has to balance exploration and exploitation and MCTS employs a number of heuristics to try to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the pseudocode, the algorithm has three key components: a tree policy (for action selection within the search tree), a default policy (for rollouts outside the search tree), and a backup function for backing up accumulated rewards over the simulated episode. We will first implement an example for each of these, and then put them together into the complete algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version in the algorithm is summerized in the following pseudocode:\n",

    "You can import a generic graph structure with state nodes and action nodes, and implement a set of classes defining corresponding states and actions using the code below, aimed to integrate RL worlds from module 2 (in this case the windy cliff world). State nodes have these state objects as attributes, which in turn have position attribute returning the location in the maze. \n",
    "\n",
    "Action objects have the attribute move, which tell you the direction (0 to 3) corresponding to that action. You can change, and extend the reward function later to better solve the task. Please study the code below and graph.py for more details.\n",
