We will encode the heading direction of a subject in two neural populations with Poisson variability, then integrate the information from these populations to calculate the posterior through a simple application of Bayes' rule.\n",

    "Write a function to generate, given an angle, the response rates in the visual and vestibular populations, with 30 neurons each. Neurons in each population should have equally spaced preferred stimuli between 0 and 180 degrees, and otherwise identical tuning curves $f_i(s)$. You are welcome to experiment with different values for the gains and for the standard deviation that defines the shape of the tuning curves, or you can use the following:  $g_{vi}=40$, $g_{ve}=80$, and $\\sigma=40$.\n",
