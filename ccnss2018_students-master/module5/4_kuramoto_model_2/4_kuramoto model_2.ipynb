We only evaluate the value of $f(E,I,t)$ or $g(E,I,t)$ at time $t$. Therefore, we are predicting the (future) value of $E(t+\\Delta t)$ solely based on the values at the current moment, $t$.\n","\n","Based on this observation, we can generalize Euler method.

With Runge-Kutta method, we begin with writing Wilson-Cowan equation as the following:\n","\n","$$ \\frac{E(t+\\Delta t)- E(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\{ f(E(t),I(t),t)+ f(E(t+\\Delta t), I(t+\\Delta t),t+\\Delta t) \\},$$\n","\n","Now, as an approximation, we write:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\tilde E(t+\\Delta t) &= E(t) + \\Delta t f(E(t),I(t),t) \\\\\n","E(t+\\Delta t) &= E(t) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\{f(E(t),I(t),t) +f(\\tilde E(t+\\Delta t),\\tilde I(t+\\Delta t),t+\\Delta t) \\}, \\\\\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","and similarly for the $I$.\n","\n","\n","• Write an expression of Runge-Kutta method applied to the following Kuramoto model with two nodes:\n","\n","$$ \\frac {d \\theta_1(t)} {dt} = \\omega_1 + \\frac{K}{N} \\sin( \\theta_2(t) - \\theta_1(t)),  \\quad  \\\\  \\frac {d \\theta_2(t)} {dt} = \\omega_2 + \\frac{K}{N} \\sin( \\theta_1(t) - \\theta_2(t)) .$$\n","\n","• Write the code for above equation.
