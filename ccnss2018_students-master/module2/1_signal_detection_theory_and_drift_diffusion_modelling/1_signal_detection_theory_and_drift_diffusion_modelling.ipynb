    "## Background (SDT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal detection theory (SDT) is used when we want to measure the way we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty (for example: how well would we detect the presence of a car in front of us, while driving under foggy conditions). \n",
    "\n",
    "SDT assumes that the decision maker is not a passive receiver of information, but an active decision-maker who makes difficult perceptual judgments under conditions of uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example: Imgine we are in foggy circumstances, and we are forced to decide whether there is an object in front of us based solely on visual stimulus (which is impaired by the fog). The density of the fog makes detecting a car in front of us more difficult (and is a function of your distance from the car and the fog density). \n",
    "\n",
    "Signal Detection Theory can be applied to a data set where stimuli is either present or absent (e.g. stim = car, or no_car), and the observer responds to each trial based on whether he/she detects the stimulus as 'present' or 'absent' (detect=car, or no_car). These tasks are also known as 2-Alternative Forced Choice tasks (2-AFC for short). In such tasks, the trials can be sorted into one of four categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal detection theory is a means to quantify the ability to differentiate between valid information (signal) and noise. Multiple measures can be extracted using SDT: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the $d'$ (pronoumced dee-prime): is a measure of sensitivity (how hard/easy is it to perceive a stimulus under uncertainty). \n",
    "            *How easy/hard is it to see a car under foggy conditions for each participant?*\n",
    "* the bias (sometimes called 'threshold') '$c$': is a measure of bias in discriminating signal from noise. \n",
    "            *Does each participant have a tendency to overestimate or underestimate a car being present?*\n",
    "* the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC): enables to illustrate the ability of a participant to discriminate between signal and noise as the threshold and/or uncertainty is varied. \n",
    "            *How does the participant ability to detect a car changes as a function of fog density*\n",

    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphically, you may think of the signal and the noise are overlapping distributions (signal: red distribution, noise: blue distribution). The threshold (or bias) is a boundary that separates the signal from the noise and defines whether the participant responds 'present' or 'not present'. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the threshold is set very low, noise might inadvertently be classified as signal (i.e. many false positives (FP)). \n",

    "**Note:** SDT measures can also be used to study any kind of binary classifiers (say: how good is a routine test at detecting cancer). In this case, having a conservative bias (low threshold) would result in more false positive, but depending on the application it could be a good thing. For example, it is better to have a high false alarm rate for detecting cancer that would lead to a follow-up in a clinic, rather than missing true positive (cancer being present, and the test returning that it isn't).\n",

    "The Drift Diffusion Model arises from the Sequential Probability Ratio Test in the limit where discretely presented evidence becomes continuously presented evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example. Say a participant is shown a blurry stimulus that is either a face or a house, and the participant needs to respond either 'face' or 'house' (2-AFC). Once a stimulus is displayed, the participant accumulates information over time by looking at the stimulus (the longer the participant looks at the stimulus, the more confident he/she will be that it is either a house or a face). The information accumulated with a drift-rate '$\\mu$', and when the participant trace hits a decision-boundary '$-B$' or '$B$', the participant responds 'house' or 'face' respectively. We can change the bias of a given participant '$z$', by changing the starting point of the accumulation trace with respect to the decision boundaries '$-B$' or '$B$'. If we move '$z$' to be closer to '$-B$' than to '$B$', then the participant will be more likely to respond 'face' (i.e. a bias in responding for faces).\n",
